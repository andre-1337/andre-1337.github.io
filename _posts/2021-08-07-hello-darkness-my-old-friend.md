back in black!

hey there! as you can see, there was quite the change around here. we cleaned up a little bit, and made it cozy.

i have worked on the theme for the blog, and now it has colors that are more pleasing to the eyes, making it easier on your eyes. i have also changed the aspect of code blocks, since they looked pretty boring. now we have proper syntax highlighting, with line count and everything!

from now on, the stream of posts will be somewhat more consistent. i will also try to expand the topics discussed here, as to make it friendlier for non-programmers.

i hope you enjoy the change; hopefully it's for the better!

remember: stay safe out there. drink some water. go outside and take a nice walk during the evening. fresh air does wonders, trust me. see you around! &#10084;
