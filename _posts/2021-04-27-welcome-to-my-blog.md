the talk about github pages today in the r/pltd discord server spiked my interest. i always wanted to have my own simple website, with a blog section so i could have fun typing away. i actually did it, and i hope people enjoy the silly little things that i post here. i will be mainly focusing on stories, talking about programming, and my passion for language design and implementation. thank you for stopping by!
