and so, i became a blogger.

the talk over at the r/pltd discord server really spiked my interest on github pages and how you can host your own little website for free with it. i wanted a small platform where i could do some blogging and have a neat little website, so i decided to join the github pages train, and i must admit, it's really easy to get it all set up! i will be mostly posting stories from my day-to-day experience, as well as some programming related posts, or some posts that are more "technical". i hope people enjoy reading these as much as i enjoy writing them!
