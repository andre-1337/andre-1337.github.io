we're back!

it's been a while since my last blog post. i had a massive mind block, meaning that i could not come up with any topic to talk about or discuss. there were also some more events in the meantime, which i think are relevant and i should talk about.

i've changed operating systems! i used manjaro xfce not too long ago, for an entire month. i loved the experience, but i missed being able to game with higher frames. after that month, i decided to go back to windows 10. but i missed the essence and simplicity of linux. it doesn't hand you everything in a silver platter; sometimes you need to dig deep into the guts of the beast to make something work. most of the time, windows sorts things out for you. i loved that aspect. having to be hands on. not relying on the operating system.

i saw the windows 11 announcement video, and all the videos about the leaked build, and to be quite frank... it's a steamy piece of garbage. don't get me wrong, i like the ui design. but it's pretty much windows 10 in some new clothes. microsoft should focus more on making windows a more resource-friendly system, instead of just changing the ui. and all their talk about not having updates with intrusive features (i'm looking at you, weather and news task bar widget) in windows 11? i think it's just a way for them to try and win over some people.

i'm going to stick with ubuntu (my current linux distro) until windows 11 releases **but** i will continue using linux, and dual boot windows 11 so i can have the best of both worlds.

also, some changes will be coming to the blog. the theme that the blog currently runs on was made by me. but it looks rather dull and boring, so i'm going to change that. i'm going to be introducing **dark mode**, and changing the overall look of everything. i think it will be a welcome change that old (and new!) readers might enjoy. the changes will not be visible once this post goes out, since i will be working on everything locally. i don't want to break the blog. i'll work on everything, give it a nice coat of polish and then update everything. but for now, say your prayers. this theme will be gone soon, and it will not be coming back.

and as a last note, blog posts will be more frequent! i hope people enjoy my insight in several different topics and enjoy reading through my rather long posts.

anyhow, see you around! and remember, be safe out there. stay hydrated. keep in touch with your loved ones. &#10084;
