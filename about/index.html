  hi! name's <strong>Andr√©</strong>. i'm a 20 year old male from <strong>Portugal</strong>. 
  i'm a very nerdy person.
  i love everything related to computers and gaming. i also like cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  i'm a hobbyist language developer. i've been working on a language called <strong>EverScript</strong>.
  <br>
  i've been also working on a compiler for my other language, called <strong>Synthium</strong>.
  <br>
  <br>
  even though computers in general are one of my passions, i also love gaming.
  you'll probably find me in <strong>Stardew Valley</strong>, making my way around the 
  village doing little tasks and having fun. or perhaps, in the deep mines of 
  <strong>Minecraft</strong>, hunting those sweet, shiny diamonds. or maybe, trying to 
  pop some heads in <strong>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</strong>. possibly, chasing 
  circles in <strong>osu!</strong>. whatever it is, i'm always having a fun time, either 
  gaming or just creating wonky bits of software.
  <br>
  <br>
  i also enjoy music. like, a lot. i've been listening to work from one of my favorite
  artists, <strong>Mixed Matches</strong>. his stuff is G O O D. and i mean that.
  <br>
  <br>
  you can find me in <strong>Discord</strong>, usually roaming on the r/pltd server,
  lurking around and trying to figure out what most of the technical terms mean.
  i also have <strong>Instagram</strong>, where i occasionally post some pictures
  that i take during my walks.
  <br>
  <br>
  anyways, i hope that you enjoy the content that will be posted, and that each post keeps bringing you
  back for more! your presence and appreciation are welcome!
